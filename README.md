# Ergonomica

**WARNING**: `master` on this repository is *not* the same as a stable release! Currently, this software is purely experimental, as I am cleaning it up substantially after a long hiatus. However, if you find bugs, feel free to file an issue.

Ergonomica is a cross-platform shell language implemented in Python that aims to redesign the shell in a more standard, easy-to-use, and powerful way than traditional shells. It is designed as a fully-functional S-expression based language with a few traditional shell features such as flags and piping to combine the functionality of a Lisp with the convenience of the UNIX shell.
