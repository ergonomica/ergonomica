 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
  authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
	    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
	        "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
	    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
	        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
		    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
		        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
			    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
	    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
	        work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
	    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
	        customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
	    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
	        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
		    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
		        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
			    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
			        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
				    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
				        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
					    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
	    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
	        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
		    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
	    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
	        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
		    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
		        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
			    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
			        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
				    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
				        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
					    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
					        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
	    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
	        charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.
