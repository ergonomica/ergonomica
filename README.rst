# Ergonomica

Ergonomica is a cross-platform shell language implemented in Python that aims to redesign the shell in a more standard, easy-to-use, and powerful way than traditional shells. It is designed as a fully-functional S-expression based language with a few traditional shell features such as flags and piping to combine the functionality of a Lisp with the convenience of the UNIX shell.
